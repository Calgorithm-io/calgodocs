Calgorithm is a Slack app and will require you to connect a few essential business tools

1. Google Calendar

Use the Slack slash command /schedule to open Calgorithm, and you’ll be prompted to begin onboardin

Click the button to open a browser window and sign into your calendar. Follow the prompts to give Calgorithm access to your calendar. Once you’re signed in, you’ll be directed to return to Slack.

2. Salesforce

When you return to Slack, you’ll find the next prompt to sign into Salesforce.

Click the button to open a browser window and sign into Salesforce. Follow the prompts. Once you’re signed in, you’ll be directed to return to Slack.

3. Conferencing

When you return to Slack, you’ll find the next prompt to set up video conferencing. Because Calgorithm will create meetings for you, you will find it useful for Calgorithm to also create conference links for you.

**Zoom**
The process to sign into Zoom will be the same as for Google Calendar and Salesforce; follow the prompts and then return to Slack.


**Google Meet**
If you use Google Meet, click “Yes; I use Google Meet”. Because Google Meet is part of Google Calendar, you don’t need to sign in again.

4. Working Hours

The last step of onboarding is to set your working hours.

Click the button to open the form to set your working hours. It will default to 8:00a - 5:00p Monday through Friday in your timezone. Change it as appropriate.
