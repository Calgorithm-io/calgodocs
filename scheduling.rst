Scheduling
==========

After everything’s set up, you’re ready to use Calgorithm. Calgorithm can either create new meetings with a resource (best experience) or add a resource to an existing meeting. Use the Slack slash command /schedule to open the scheduling menu.


======================
Creating a New Meeting
======================

To create a new meeting, click “No; create it for me!”. This opens the scheduling form that will help you find a time and resource for your meeting.


*Who are we talking to?*
	Your meeting must be tied to an opportunity. Select your opportunity from the list; type to search. Opportunities will only be displayed if they are open and you are the owner. If you haven’t yet created the opportunity, click the shortcut link to go straight to the opportunity creation page in Salesforce.

*How much time do we need?*
	Select the duration of your meeting.

*When’s your preferred time?*
	Type in when you want the meeting to occur. Calgorithm will search for availability on and around the time you enter.

After entering the day and time, confirm that Calgorithm has read your input correctly and select the value that appears in the menu.

*Ways to Input Times*
	You can type in an exact date and time, like “January 11 at 3:00 pm”, but you can also use relative terms like “Monday at 3pm” to indicate the coming Monday, “next Monday at 3pm” to indicate the Monday after that, or even “in 2 weeks”.

**1. Choosing a Time**
	Once you’ve chosen your opportunity, duration, and time, you’ll be presented with a list of meeting times that have an available resource. If a time is not displayed, it means there is no resource available at that time for your opportunity.

	Calgorithm will prioritize times that are on or similar to your desired time. Click “Book It” to select a time.

	To see availability for the full week, scroll down and open the “Complete Availability” dropdown. You can also select a time from this menu.

**2. Creating a Meeting**
	After you select a time, you’ll add the details of your meeting. Here, you will see which resource was assigned, set the meeting title (a default title will be added automatically), add your guests, a meeting description, and internal notes for your resource.

*Guest List*
	The guest list will pull from your Salesforce contacts that are linked to the account of the opportunity you selected. If your guest or guests aren’t yet in Salesforce, add them by clicking the shortcut link. Make sure your contacts have their emails and titles set.
*External Meeting Description*
	The external meeting description shows up in the calendar meeting -- do your customer a favor and set a clear agenda for the meeting.
*Internal Notes*
	Internal notes will not show up in the calendar meeting. They are for your resource’s eyes only. Give your resource all of the background they need for the meeting.
*Internal Syncs*
	Maybe there’s enough complexity to the opportunity that you want to schedule an internal prep with your resource. Maybe you expect the call to have several follow-up items and you want to schedule an internal debrief with your resource. Use the before and after options to have Calgorithm automatically find time and schedule pre and post-meeting syncs with your resource.
*Create Event*
	Once you’ve filled out the form, click “Create Event” to create the event and any internal syncs you’ve selected. Calgorithm will take care of adding your resource and guests to the event, so long as those guests have email addresses in Salesforce; if not, you’ll be prompted to add them. If you opted to have Calgorithm create conferences for you, it’ll add conference links to the customer meeting and internal syncs as well.

========================================
Adding a Resource to an Existing Meeting
========================================
To add a resource to a meeting that’s already on your calendar, click “No; create it for me!”. This opens the scheduling form that will help you find a resource for your meeting.

*Which event is it?*
	Select the event you need a resource for. You can type to search.
*Which opportunity is this tied to?*
	Your meeting must be tied to an opportunity. Select your opportunity from the list; type to search. Opportunities will only be displayed if they are open and you are the owner. If you haven’t yet created the opportunity, click the shortcut link to go straight to the opportunity creation page in Salesforce.

**Booking**
1. Finding a Resource
	If a resource is available for your event, you’ll be able to click “Book It” to add them.
2. Adding the Resource
	After you find the resource, you’ll see which resource was assigned.

*Internal Notes*
	Internal notes will not show up in the calendar meeting. They are for your resource’s eyes only. Give your resource all of the background they need for the meeting.
*Internal Syncs*
	Maybe there’s enough complexity to the opportunity that you want to schedule an internal prep with your resource. Maybe you expect the call to have several follow-up items and you want to schedule an internal debrief with your resource. Use the before and after options to have Calgorithm automatically find time and schedule pre and post-meeting syncs with your resource.

*Add Resource*
	Once you’ve filled out the form, click “Add Resource” to add your resource to the event and create any internal syncs you’ve selected.


=========================
Viewing Upcoming Meetings
=========================

To view meetings that Calgorithm has scheduled for you, go to the Calgorithm app’s home page in Slack by selecting the app from the “Apps” list in your left-side Slack sidebar and then selecting “Home” at the top.

Your upcoming meetings in the current week will be displayed on the page. To view future weeks, use the dropdown menu.

You will be able to see the meeting time, attendees, and internal notes for the meeting. 

You can click the meeting title to go straight to the event in Google Calendar. You can also click the three-dot menu in the top right of the event to go straight to the opportunity in Salesforce.
